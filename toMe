Dear two weeks ago me,

Ruby is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy less user friendly than I thought.
It makes up it's own rules and follows no structure that you are used to. 
You should open your mind larger, and quit relying on old ideas to get you sorted through this.
It's not a terrible way of doing things.  At first I thought that it was less intuitive, but as the basics
trickle in, it seems as if it is more intuitive.

But ffs why can't I use a for loop?
