Dear me from two weeks ago,
  I know that you knew this was going to be difficult, but I think you have grossly underestimated your time management skills. Make sure that you use your weekends wiser than you normally do. I know that you enjoy sleep and not talking to anyone more than anything in the owrld, but I think that you are going to have to start being a team player who maintains a state of waking on the regular. This sucks, I know. 
  Perhaps you thought that since Ruby was not a ridiculously structured language, it would make more sense inherently and come together outright. You are wrong. Learn to let go of what you think you know, and move forward without it for now. You can revisit old knowledge some other time, not now. 
  Maybe you should have a more open attitude, not a closed off misdirected sense of humor. 
Now that that is out of the way, you can get started. 
Ruby is fun. You just have to think backwards. write down what you want to say, and then flip it over. It's not rocket surgery, it has a subject and predicate; but sometimes, as in life, the verbs are all you need. Don't waste your time with extraneous blathering. Just pretend you are the psycho killer from the Talking Heads song. Say something once, why say it again? They were a pretty decent band, after all. And you do kind of stay up all night. Thank god there's no baby.

  Anyway, just remember who you are and what you are capable of. You are just as capable of being great, as you are hamstringing yourself with words. Keep it simple. And seriously, shut the fuck up.

Yo,
yourself.
