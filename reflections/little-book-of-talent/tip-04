=======================Tip 4: Buy a notebook=========================
Keeping a notebook is more than just a map for your brain, it is closer to GPS
It updates in real time, and shows important milestones and waypoints you may forget about if you don't stop there every day.
Writing something down makes the idea more tangible and clear. It cements it in your reality, as opposed to remaining
the abstraction of a good idea that you once had.
